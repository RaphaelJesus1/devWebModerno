            <p>
                This game is based on a mathematical problem that emerged during a contest in a television program 
                shown on 70's, called <span class="italic">Let's Make a Deal</span>.

                <h3>Preparations...</h3>
                <p>
                    Insert how many doors will be in your game.
                    At last, choose which door will be the rewarded one.
                    Doors are created from number "1" to (amount of doors you chose).
                </p>
                    <span class="danger">Watch out:</span> <span class="italic">if you choose an out of range number, your game won't have rewarded doors.</span>

                <p>
                    The application will render all doors and they'll be closed.
                    You can mark (or unmark) a door as hunt by left-clicking it.
                    Many doors can be marked at the same time.
                    After you decide what door you want to open, click on its knob and... voil√†! It's opened!
                </p>
